# spacey v 0.1.1

* This version patches behavior where elevation requests via `get_heightmap`
  would frequently fail due to the USGS providing bad URLs as responses.

# spacey v 0.1.0

* Initial release!
* Get height maps (using `get_heightmap`) and image overlays (using 
  `get_image_overlay`) for a set of lat/long coordinates (of any length!)
* Automatically get your data and make beautiful maps using `automap`
